Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.- NoSQL DBMS: Designed for unstructured data and scalability challenges, supporting document, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j.- In-memory DBMS: Stores data in the main memory to achieve faster response times. Examples include Redis and SAP HANA.Choosing the Right DBMS:- The selection depends on the specific requirements, such as data complexity, scalability needs, and performance criteria. Consider factors like data model support, transaction throughput, and ecosystem compatibility.\"\n",
